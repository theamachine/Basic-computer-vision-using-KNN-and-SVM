# Basic-computer-vision-using-KNN-and-SVM
The purpose of this project is to gain some experience working with the tools you will use throughout the course. You will learn:
- The basics of data loading and preparation
- Classification using the k-NN algorithm
- Classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Calculation of metrics to assess the performance of your model
## Part 0. Dataset Preparation
To complete the project you will need to download the Cifar10 dataset and devise an appropriate training set split. You may acquire the dataset using the method of your choice. Note that some sources e.g. sklearn have reduced the samples to only 1797 (this could negatively affect your results). If you use the full dataset, you are free to sample from the dataset to reduce the overal training samples. The overall accuracy is less important than your  observations and comparisons. For example classifying the full 10,000 test images might take approximately 15 minutes using k-NN.

In this section:
<ul>
<li>Download the dataset as described above</li>
<li>Divide the raw data into appropriate training and test sets for both the images and corresponding labels for use with the subsequent parts of the project.</li>
<li>Visualize five samples of each class by plotting a grid using the matplotlib library.</li>
</ul>
